# Indoor human tracking with frequency modulated continuous-wave radar

### Brief To-Do list
1. Identify a suitable subset of data to be analized (single user + single room?)
2. Noise filtering (static)
	1. openCV non local means
	https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means.html
	2. randomized pca

		2. Soft reference: https://www.quora.com/What-is-randomized-PCA
	3. SVM ?
	4. K-means

3. Noise filtering (dynamic) 
	- exploiting the knowledge of data evolution through time
4. Clustering
	1. DBSCAN
	2. SVM?
	3. K-means
	4. Gaussian Mixture
5. Removing clusters generated by chance
	- computing probability of having a randomly generated bump (che ne pensi?)
6. Tracking
	- Identifing cluster centroid + dispersion
	- Regularization of the trajectory
7. Conclusions
