# Indoor Human Walking Path Reconstruction from a FMCW Radar Signal

## Repository Description
Three jupyter notebooks describe the main steps of the analysis:
1. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction,
2. Spline and SOM,
3. Autoencoders.

In addition, three python files are used to store useful functions:
1. process.py,
2. denoising.py,
3. clustering.py,

plus a file that can be used to perform the whole preprocessing called features_extraction.py.
