# Indoor human tracking with frequency modulated continuous-wave radar

### Brief To-Do list
1. Identify a suitable subset of data to be analized (single user + single room?)
2. Noise filtering (static)
	1. openCV non local means
	https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means.html
	2. randomized pca

	Something about it:
		1. Hard reference: http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~jtropp/papers/HMT11-Finding-Structure-SIREV.pdf
		2. Soft reference: https://www.quora.com/What-is-randomized-PCA
	3. SVM ?
3. Noise filtering (dynamic) exploiting the knowledge of data evolution through time
4. Clustering
	1. DBSCAN
	2. SVM?
5. Removing clusters generated by chance
	computing probability of having a randomly generated bump (che ne pensi?)
6. Tracking
	Identifing cluster centroid + dispersion
7. Conclusions
